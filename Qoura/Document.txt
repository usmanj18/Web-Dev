..........................Making Files and Folders.................................

1st of all make a Folder named Qoura. now install npm init to make package.json file. then install express and ejs in it. make two folders views and public

	1.public is for style.css and other files to be stored.
	2.views acts as database from where we will be sending the index.ejs (html file) to the server.

also create an app.js file in qoura folder. now open the app.js and require the express in it . set the path using 

	const path=require("path");
	app.set("views",path.join(__dirname,"views"));

better add the functions for parsing the url and json files using 

	app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}));
	app.use(express.json);

...........................Making Main Page.........................................

then make a list of posts named posts in which we have username and content of each post. then send it to the ejs file using command

	app.get("/posts",(req,res)=>{
		res.render("index.ejs",{posts});
	}

go in the ejs file and aquire the username and content of post. also create a style.css file in public folder and add styling to the html code in ejs file. add the style.css to ejs by link in head and connect to app.js through commands: 
	app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,"public")));

...........................Making New Post Section..................................

Now make another file named new.ejs in the views folder and make a html form in it with method=post and action=/posts. make an input box and a textarea along with a submit button.

Go to app.js and make a get function with address /posts/new and send the response as new.ejs (it will give them that form in new.ejs)

now make post function and store the username and content that was added in form and push them in the array of posts. now make function res.redirect with url to /posts. it will basically take you to main page whenever you click submit button on new post.

Now go to index.html and add an anchor tag with link /posts/new. so it will take you to new post form and submit button on that page will take you back here after adding new post.

..........................Showing Details of Post........................

you have to make an ejs file named show and make three paragraphs as id,name and content.
Make a get function with url posts/:id that will search the id given from the id's of post using posts.find function Go to index.html and make an anchor tag along with name and content and give it a link to posts/:<%=post.id%>. it will take you to the id of the post you are clicking on.
now make id's. for this go to gitbash and install npm i uuid. after this, require it as const {v4:uuidv4}=require('uuid');
now go to the posts array and add id=uuidv4(); it will add random id to post. now in get function store req.params in id. search it using posts.find and pass that to the show.ejs.
modify the app.post a bit. add a variable id=uuidv4(); and pass the id along with content and name

............................Editing Posts...............................

Make an anchor tag in index.ejs and give it a link to posts/<%=post.id%>/edit. now make a get function with url posts/:id/edit and get id as req.params. then find the post through id using posts.find and parse the edit.ejs along with post to the res.render.make a file named edit.ejs and display the id and username in it. make a form and in it place a textarea with name-content and post.content (it will place already written content of post in it). create a submit button there too.
now the problem is that you cannot make the patch method directly on the form. for this we use method override. run command npm i method-override to install it. to use it write the method=post and in action write /posts/<%post.id%>?_method=PATCH and in app.js require it as const methodOverride=require("method-override"); and place a line app.use(methodOverride("_method");it will search for _method in the ejs file.
Now we are going to make app.patch function and receive the id and search for the particular post. now store the req.body.content in variable newContent and make post.content=newContent. Afterall redirect it to the posts.

.................................Deleting Post............................

for this make a form in index.ejs and inside it make a delete button. in the form method write post and in action="/posts/<%=post.id%>?_method=DELETE">. now come to app.js and make function app.delete with url /posts/"id
get the id and search for filter where id!==p.id and store it into posts array. then redirect the page to /posts
